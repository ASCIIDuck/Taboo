The config.yml should be created and contain something similar to the following:

lightning:
- pwn
kick:
- candlejack
giant:
- synergy
zombies:
- Voldemort

Where pwn, candlejack, synergy and Voldemort are words you want to make taboo. The YAML nodes are the punishements,

lightning: strike the player with a bolt of lightning
kick: kick the player
giant: spawn a giant at the players location
zombies: spawn three zombies at the players location
