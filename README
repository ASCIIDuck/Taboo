The config.yml must be created manually at the time being (Taboo/config.yml in your plugins directory) and contain something similar to the following:

lightning:
- pwn
- umad
kick:
- candlejack
giant:
- synergy
zombies:
- Voldemort

Where pwn, candlejack, synergy and Voldemort are words you want to make taboo. The YAML nodes are the punishements,

lightning: strike the player with a bolt of lightning
kick: kick the player
giant: spawn a giant at the players location
zombies: spawn three zombies at the players location


You do not need to specify all nodes.

Each word will be search for in everything said by players. The search will ignore case and will match parts of words. For example if you set "pass" as taboo, "password" would also be taboo. To avoid things like this you can add entries like this (note the spaces)
zombies:
- ' pass '
