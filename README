====Configuration===
The config.yml must be created manually at the time being (Taboo/config.yml in your plugins directory).

The format is as follows:

[code]
<tabooname>:
    actions:
    - <action1>
    - <action2>
    patterns:
    - <bannedword1>
    - <bannedword2>
    excludePermission: <permissionNode>
    includePermission: <permissionNode>
[/code]
==TabooName==
The tabooname can be anything and is not used by any part of the code. It's just there to help you organize things. It is required.

==Actions==
These list what happens when someone breaks the taboo. The current actions are:
lightning: strike the player with a bolt of lightning
kick: kick the player
giant: spawn a giant at the players location
zombies: spawn three zombies at the players location
explode: an explosion at the player's position, half the strength of TNT

==Patterns==
These are the words that are searched for. Each word is searched for in a player's message, ignoring case.
If you set "word" to be taboo, it will match against "sword","password","crossword", etc. If you want it to only match word, define as follows:
        - '(^|\W)word(\W|$)'
Also, you can define a pattern that will replace the taboo word with another word. To do this define the pattern like so:
        - 's/rofl/rolling on the floor laughing/'
This will replace "rofl" with rolling on the floor laughing in the player's message before it is displayed.

==Permissions==
Permissions are checked using the new, built in Bukkit Permissions. There are no plans to make this compatible with older permissions plugins.
The node you specify will be prepended with "taboo.", so if you set the excludePermission to be "admin", the permission a user would need is "taboo.admin".
If no includePermission is specified it will default to applying to everyone.


==Example===
[code]
politics:
    actions:
    - lightning
    patterns:
    - obama
    - glenn beck
    censor: true
    permission: nopolitics
[/code]
