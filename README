The config.yml must be created manually at the time being (Taboo/config.yml in your plugins directory) and contain something similar to the following:

<tabooname>:
    actions:
    - <action1>
    - <action2>
    patterns:
    - <bannedword1>
    - <bannedword2>
    permission: <permissionNode>
    censor: <true|false>

Permission and censor are optional. The permissionNode parameter will be appended with "taboo.", so if the permsission parameter is "users" then the permission node will be "taboo.users". The taboo group will apply to users with the "taboo.users" permission given to them. An example is:

politics:
    actions:
    - lightning
    patterns:
    - obama
    - glenn beck
    censor: true
    permission: nopolitics


The possible actions are:

lightning: strike the player with a bolt of lightning
kick: kick the player
giant: spawn a giant at the players location
zombies: spawn three zombies at the players location


Patterns:
Each word will be search for in everything said by players. The search will ignore case and will match parts of words. For example if you set "pass" as a pattern, "password" would also be matched. To avoid things like this you can add entries like this (note the spaces)
    patterns:
    - ' pass '
